## About the Video Course
Deep learning is the next step to a more advanced implementation of machine learning. The course resolves the confusion between machine learning and deep learning by focusing only on deep learning concepts. Deep learning techniques are used in real-world scenarios such as image scanning, face detection, and many more. It is important to know deep learning algorithms as they are currently trending in sectors such as healthcare, finance, and many more. This hands-on course will help you tackle various issues that you come across while building your Deep Learning applications in the healthcare domain. Right from building your neural nets to reinforcement learning and working with different Deep Learning applications such as computer Vision and voice and image recognition, this course will be your guide in tackling different situations and issues and provide the end to end application of deep learning concepts in the healthcare domain. By the end of the course, you will be able to build neural networks and Deep learning models for your own projects.
